## Notes

- Treat `docs/ops/*` as the primary source for post-release hardening and day-2 operations.
- Treat preview QA as production-equivalent data risk because preview currently uses production-equivalent non-secret runtime values.

## Product Surface

Current direction:
- `/products/` is now the primary product discovery surface for public browsing.
- The main product page uses a clean brand-module grid: brand name, stable count badge, a few product preview pills, and a single `查看产品` entry.
- `/products/` keeps one search input and filters brand modules by brand name, product name, and use case text only.
- Full product cards and compare actions now live on `/products/[brand]/`, not on the main `/products/` page.
- Brand pages keep comparison lightweight with a hard cap of 3 selected products and no compare-specific search box.
- The product surface intentionally keeps copy sparse and placeholder visuals minimal and product-name led.
- Public product scope is now focused on AR / AI glasses. Apple Vision Pro and XR-headset framing are removed from the main public product surface.
- Legacy `/devices/` routes are no longer a primary public discovery surface and should redirect users back into `/products/`.

## Device Library

Current production baseline:
- Production URL: `https://openglasshub.pages.dev`
- Latest production/main commit: `475fd71eee66d62b8962323879158ba27169a652`
- No DB migration has been added for the Device Library release stack so far.
- No production data was touched by the Device Library releases so far.

Release stack:
- Device Library MVP v1
  Routes: `/devices/` and `/devices/[slug]/`
  Data source: static local data in `src/data/devices.ts`
  Scope: 13 seed devices, public no-auth access, search/filter/card/detail pages, custom 404 for unknown device slugs
- Device Library Accuracy & Comparison v1
  Added static accuracy metadata: `verification_level`, `specs_verified`, `last_checked_label`, `source_links`, `comparison_highlights`, `limitations`
  Added verification badges, source/accuracy sections, conservative caveat copy, and lightweight comparison for up to 3 devices
  Missing comparison values render as `TBD`
  Policy: do not invent precise specs; unverified values should be omitted, marked `TBD`, or left as not verified
- Device Discussion Entry v1
  Added `讨论这台设备` section on device detail pages
  Added discussion entry links to `/feed/?compose=1&device=<slug>`, `/posts/new/?device=<slug>`, `/circles/`, and the current `/products/` surface
  `/feed/` shows a safe discussion banner for known device context
  `/posts/new/` supports safe starter copy based on known local device data
  No auto-post and no auto-submit behavior

Architecture and safety notes:
- Legacy device routes remain available only as downline redirects for old links and discussion context.
- Product discovery is now brand-first on `/products/`, while `/devices/` should not be treated as a primary browsing surface.
- Device pages now include SEO metadata plus conservative JSON-LD structured data for the library and device detail pages.
- Device discussion context is query-param based and only activates for known local device slugs.
- Device slug input is sanitized and must match entries in `src/data/devices.ts`.
- No arbitrary query text is injected into post prefill.
- Source/verification labels are guidance, not guarantees that every field is complete or final.
- Structured data intentionally omits prices, offers, ratings, and reviews unless those fields can be verified safely.
- Comparison is a lightweight MVP meant for high-level orientation rather than exhaustive buying decisions.
- Existing feed, circles, and device browsing flows remain separate from post creation until a user explicitly acts.

Future work:
- DB-backed device pages
- sourced spec ingestion/update workflow
- community corrections
- user reviews
- related posts aggregation per device
- device-specific circles or tags
- richer comparison table
- image/media handling for devices
- full sitemap and SEO audit
