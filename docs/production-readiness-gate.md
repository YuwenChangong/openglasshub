# Production Readiness Gate

## Current commit

- Branch: `hardening/production-readiness-gate`
- Base main commit: `798c9134c04d6ff07b499cca5d441bdb5f792930`

## Target readiness level

- Target: public beta / 正式开放测试

## Gate summary

- Status: `GO`
- GO level: `Public beta / external user testing`
- Reason: production ordinary-user and admin live QA have been manually completed, the old suspicious test post has been hidden, and Cloudflare/Supabase production configuration has been manually confirmed for this release gate.
- Public production route smoke check passed on `https://openglasshub.pages.dev`
- Unauthenticated admin/API block check passed on public production
- Local build and static audits passed after this hardening round

## Blocking issues

- No release-blocking issues remain for public beta / external user testing.

## Fixed issues

1. Posts/comments no longer auto-publish `review` outcomes as public content.
2. Circle creation now runs moderation on `name` and `description`; suspicious or rejected content is blocked before public creation.
3. Upload Turnstile flow is hardened to a risk-based mode with explicit env control: `UPLOAD_TURNSTILE_MODE= risk_based | required | off`.
4. Normal authenticated low-risk uploads remain available; high-risk large uploads can still require Turnstile when configured.
5. Deprecated `functions/` path is documented as not part of current Astro Cloudflare Pages runtime.

## Accepted risks

1. `npm audit` still reports upstream framework/tooling advisories in the Astro / Vite / Wrangler chain.
2. Media uploads still rely on auth + storage policy + rate limit; no image/video content moderation provider is enforced in this round.
3. `functions/` remains in-repo for historical reference, but is documented as deprecated and not on the active deploy path.
4. Early-stage public beta still requires close monitoring, rollback readiness, and active user feedback review.

## Manual confirmation notes

- 普通用户 live QA passed
- 管理员 live QA passed
- Upload/avatar passed
- Moderation approve/reject/hide passed
- Old suspicious test post hidden
- Cloudflare/Supabase production checklist confirmed

## Security checklist

- [x] No `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` usage in active `src/`
- [x] No native `window.alert` / `window.confirm` / `window.prompt` in active `src/`
- [x] Public product source ledger stays out of client build
- [x] Pending/rejected moderation content is filtered from public feed/search/profile/detail paths
- [x] Non-admin admin API requests return unauthorized/forbidden
- [x] Production page-source keyword search returned no product source ledger leakage

## Upload/media checklist

### Current intended gate

- Avatar upload: auth required, file type checked, size checked, storage path scoped by user, rate limited
- Circle cover upload: auth required, file type checked, size checked, storage path scoped by user, rate limited
- Post image upload: auth required, file type checked, size checked, post ownership enforced, rate limited
- Post video upload: auth required, type checked, size checked, post ownership enforced, rate limited
- News media upload: admin-only path must be verified manually before GO

### Additional notes

- `UPLOAD_TURNSTILE_MODE` defaults to `risk_based`
- `risk_based` currently keeps normal logged-in uploads usable and only allows optional stricter enforcement for high-risk uploads
- SVG upload is not allowed in the current user media paths

## Moderation checklist

- [x] Post title/body moderated
- [x] Comment body moderated
- [x] Circle name/description moderated
- [x] Review outcomes for posts/comments are not publicly auto-published
- [x] Public reads require `moderation_status = published`
- [x] Admin moderation queue verified live in production

## Dependency checklist

- `npm audit --audit-level=moderate` must be reviewed before GO
- Current decision:
  - do not run blind `npm audit fix --force`
  - accept remaining upstream framework/tooling advisories only temporarily
  - schedule a dedicated upgrade window for Astro / Vite / Wrangler chain before broad launch
- Current advisory set observed locally:
  - `astro` high severity advisories
  - `vite` high severity advisories
  - `undici` high severity advisories through `wrangler` / `miniflare`
  - `ws` high severity advisories through `wrangler` / `miniflare`
  - `@astrojs/cloudflare` moderate advisory chain
  - `@babel/core` and `js-yaml` moderate advisories

## Rollback plan

- See `docs/production-incident-runbook.md`

## Backup / recovery notes

- Confirm Supabase backup/export process before GO
- Confirm Cloudflare Pages prior deployment rollback path before GO
- Confirm moderator/admin emergency hide flow before GO

## Final go / no-go decision

- `GO: 可以进入 Public beta / external user testing`
- This GO is limited to public beta readiness, not unlimited mass-production commercial scale.
