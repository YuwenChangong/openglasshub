# OpenGlass Hub Task Continuity

Before every task, read `docs/ops/PUBLIC_BETA_CURRENT_STATE.md`. It is the only
current release/progress baseline; other plans and reports are scoped evidence.
Verify the actual checkout, branch and source before editing. Do not reset or
overwrite another checkout's changes. If this baseline is absent in an older
checkout, use the independent checkout identified in the latest handoff; do not
fall back to an old GO report or invent another current-state document.

Reuse completed, source-applicable evidence. Do not reimplement, rerun tests or
reauthorize completed stages unless changed code/targets invalidate that evidence.
An evidence hash is not execution permission. Never replay expired/consumed
authorizations or Claims, or reuse a binding after its inputs change.

Work only on the current incomplete scope. Preserve the existing dark glass
design, components, navigation and interactions; no wholesale UI replacement.
Keep local product development independent of pending Production acceptance.

MAX_ADDITIONAL_COST_USD=0. No paid API, unverified billing risk, Production request,
database change, email, upload, deployment, Git push/merge or Catalog thaw without
the exact independent authorization and applicable cost proof. Keep private input,
credentials, frozen files and historical receipts out of edits and ordinary logs.
GROUP_1 requires its own subset approval and independent GO; it is not full E_VERIFY.

Use an independent `codex/` branch and exact `git add` paths. Inspect the diff and
worktree before a local commit. Do not push/merge if it could trigger Production or
paid CI without separate approval. End each task by updating only new completed
work/evidence, genuine issues, the current blocker, minimal next action and owner
actions in the same baseline. Do not introduce a second status/hand-off system.
